            <h2>Our Article</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Sagar Manna, and I am a passionate and driven individual 
                currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at CGC (CEC). With a graduation 
                year in 2026, I am excited to embark on a journey o
                f innovation and excellenc
                e in the tech industry.

                My love for programming
                 is rooted in my fascination with the power o
                 f C++ and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
                 . I believe that these foundational concepts are crucial for building efficient and robust software solutions. I cons
                 tantly chal
                 lenge myself to expand my knowledge in these areas and explore new ways to apply them to real-world problems.
                
                To broaden my skill set, I am c

                urrently focused on learning the MERN stack fo
                r web development. This full-stack combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js provides me with a comprehensive toolkit to create dynamic and interactive web a
                pplications.
                 Through hands-on projects and continuous learning, I aim to become a proficient MERN stack developer.
                
                Looking ahead, I
                 am determined to shape the future of t
                 echnology. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovat
                 ive solutions and advancements in the tech industry. With a strong drive to excel and a commitment to lifelong learning, I am ready to take on
                  challenges and make a positive impact in the ever-evolving world of technology.
                
                If you have any quest
                ions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out. I look forward to engaging with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.</p>
